            Concerns about the new technology’s ethics confound the art world. Even Shipley 
            voiced concerns about how AI, when used irresponsibly, could dampen creativity and the 
            authenticity of visual art.

        Jon Lam, a storyboard artist at Riot Games, said that he can’t define art. But he said that 
        using generative AI isn’t a skill but something anybody can do, using data from millions of 
        artists. He added, “Somebody left their three-year-old in front of an AI generation program, 
        and the three-year-old is just typing stuff and still created something amazing.”

        In contrast, intermedia artist and Associate Professor at San Francisco Art Institute Meredith 
        Tromble said that for artists, working with new technologies not only helps them make the art 
        that they want to make, but it also attracts attention and interest. She said, “It’s seductive
         right now,” and she implored artists to approach it “from a standpoint of curiosity rather than 
         fear.”

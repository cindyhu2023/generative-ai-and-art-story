            Decades after the death of Salvador Dalí, artist and creative technologist Nathan Shipley worked to bring the 
            iconic surrealist painter back to life with deep fake technology. New technologies gave him “the ability to 
            create things that are impossible to make otherwise,” Shipley said. In his 2017 exhibit, Dreams of Dalí, 
            he used old documentary footage of Dalí to gather enough data so that he could train the AI to create deepfakes 
            of the artist.

            Proponents of generative AI artsee AI as a tool, not a replacement for human creativity. Kate Compton, a 
            professor of Computer Science at Northwestern University described using generative AI as “making things 
            that make things.” 
            
            She described AI artmaking as essentially designing and implementing an algorithm that would then create 
            the art. She compared the new technology to the advent of photography, and how photography impacted the art 
            world. “[New tools] allow more people to make art of things that people wouldn't have traditionally made art of,” she 
            said.

            Still, concerns about the new technology’s ethics confound the art world. Even Shipley voiced concerns about how AI, when
             used irresponsibly, could dampen creativity and the authenticity of visual art

            Jon Lam, a storyboard artist at Riot Games, said that he can’t define art. But he said that using generative AI isn’t a skill but something anybody can do. He compared it to putting a three-year-old in front of an AI generation program, where they’re “just typing stuff and creating something amazing,” using data from millions of artists. 
            In contrast, Associate Professor at San Francisco Art Institute Meredith Tromble said that for artists, working with new technologies not only helps them make the art that they want to make, but it also attracts attention and interest. She added that, right now, generative AI is “seductive” for artists, and they need to approach it “from a standpoint of curiosity rather than fear.”
            Lam agreed that the new wave of generative AI in art is here to stay, but he said that the cons of the technology outweigh the pros. He believes that algorithms trained off of public images are fair use, but some models are trained on millions of copyrighted images without permission from the artists who made them. Then, when these AI programs are monetized, Lam said, “artists are kind of left in the dust.”

            Lam is pushing back against monetized AI artit with the hashtag #CreateDontScrape. The movement is reacting 
            specifically to the company Epic Games scraping from artists. The video game and software developer owns 
            ArtStation, a website for artists to upload portfolios, and they usedthat artwork to train their generative AI 
            technology without the artists’ consent. As a result, Lam is urging artists to boycott ArtStation by taking down their 
            portfolio and uploading a “no AI” image. 
        </p>

            Though Lam said artists are “traditionally a very quiet bunch,” he feels the need to take action around this cause. He described 
            his primary struggle as convincing people to empathize with the artists themselves, rather than focusing on the 
            consumption of their work. "We don't think about the human, or human side behind it, which is creating it and 
            [spending] tens of years building their craft to make this thing," he said.

            Art is a field characterized by ambiguity, and debates continue about whether art made using generative AI 
            fits within the boundaries of art Compton said she doesn’t generally view categories in art as useful, and 
            Tromble said she is still “chasing a working definition of art.”

            “I am both excited and terrified about what AI could mean for the future,” Shipley said.
